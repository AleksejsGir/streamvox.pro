### 🚀 Behavior Rules
- If I ask to "implement feature X", plan the files, then USE tools to create them.
- If I ask to "fix bug Y", read the relevant file first, then USE tools to apply the patch.
- Always check `.env` configuration compatibility when adding new features.
- Be concise. Focus on code and actions.

StreamVox is an AI-powered real-time translator for Windows. It adds live subtitles to calls, meetings, videos, streams, and mobile calls, so you can understand people in other languages in seconds.

Use StreamVox to see instant subtitles for almost any sound on your PC: online meetings, phone calls routed through Phone Link, streaming video, online courses, or games.

USE IT FOR CALLS AND MEETINGS
• Translate live conversations in Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Skype, or Discord.
• Follow international partners and colleagues in your own language while they speak.

MOBILE CALL TRANSLATION (PHONE LINK)
• Connect your iPhone or Android to Windows using Microsoft Phone Link.
• See live subtitles for phone calls on your PC screen.
• Works with regular calls and most calling apps that go through Phone Link.

MOVIES, STREAMING AND CONTENT
• Watch videos without waiting for official subtitles.
• Use the overlay mode to place subtitles on top of YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, or any video player.

GAMING AND STREAMING
• Get real-time subtitles for in-game voice chat or live streams.
• Perfect for multiplayer games with international voice chat or watching Twitch streams in other languages.

HELPFUL FOR HARD-OF-HEARING USERS
• Live on-screen subtitles can make calls and videos easier to follow for people who have difficulty hearing speech, or who need to keep the volume low.
• StreamVox is not a medical device, but it can help by turning spoken words into readable text during calls, meetings, and videos.

KEY FEATURES
• Real-time AI translation with low latency and context-aware results.
• Universal overlay: a floating subtitle window that stays on top of any app.
• Bidirectional translation: system audio (what you hear) and microphone (what you say).
• Mobile call translation via Microsoft Phone Link.
• 10+ supported languages: English, Russian, German, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Italian.
• Privacy-focused processing: audio is translated in real time and not stored after processing.
• Optimized for Windows 11 with a modern, dark-mode interface.
